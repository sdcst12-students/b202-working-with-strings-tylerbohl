##### Task 1
Write a function that searches a string for all occurrences of the word "dog" and replaces it with "kitty"
(2 points) 

##### Task 2
Take a string and make sure that it is a proper sentence, with only the first letter capitalized and the rest of the sentence in lower case. We will assume that the sentence never includes names that require capitalization.

##### Task 3
Split a string into 2 halves.  If doing so cuts a word in half, add a dash to the first line
(2 points)

##### Task 4
A string is iterable, just like a list.  Create your deck of cards list by iterating through both strings for ranks and suits, and build a list to represent a deck of cards
(2 points)

##### Problem 1
String handling is important.  We can break a string into pieces to help us look at parts one at a time using the string.split function
